# Introduction
This is the replication package for our work submitted to ICSE 2023.

``Note that we only provide the data set used in our work. Tools used to perform the work will be available after our paper's acceptance.``

# CSN<sub>WD</sub>
This directory contains the CSN<sub>WD</sub> that we built for all the subject systems used in our experiments. There are three versions of CSN<sub>WD</sub>s according to different weighting mechanisms (i.e., OWM, EWM and DWM).

``We made the class names in these files anonymous, which will be recovered after the acceptance of our work.``

# goldset
This directory contains the <i>true key classes</i> in each subject system. We collected this data set from the literature.

# Results
This directory contains the results obtained in the experiments. We use these results to answer the research questions.

## Results/RQ1/Precision and Results/RQ1/F<sub>1</sub>
These two directories contain the <i>precision</i> and <i>F<sub>1</sub></i> results of iFit and eight other approaches in the baseline, respectively. 

Because there is greater redundancy in reporting <i>Precision</i>, <i>Recall</i>, and <i>F<sub>1</sub></i> at the same times. Due to space limitation, we do not put the <i>precision</i> and <i>F<sub>1</sub></i> results in our manuscript. The file <font color="#FF0000">reasons.pdf</font> provides a detailed description of the reason why we only reported the <i>Recall</i> results in our manuscript.
